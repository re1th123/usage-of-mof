Fabrication of HMs with ligands-modified inorganic fillers improved membrane performance and morphology. Ligands-modification of MIL-125(Ti) filler with amino groups (−NH2BDC) was performed to tailor the filler material's surface properties. In continuation of prior research, we investigated the effects of non-modified and modified-ligand fillers, as well as loading variation, on functional groups and morphology. Subsequently, we conducted a pure gas permeation test using acid gas (CO2) and hydrocarbons (CH4) at 3.5 bar pressure to investigate the membrane gas transport properties. The research employs a dual model for CO2 prediction analysis, coupling established permeability models, Maxwell and Lewis-Nielsen. The synergetic effect of modified-ligands filler and optimum loading exhibited substantial CO2 permeability (961.77 Barrer) and gas pair selectivity (30.86) for 9.0NH2-MIL-125(Ti) HM, surpassing the upper limit of 2008 Robeson plot. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","CO<sub>2</sub> permeability; Hybrid membrane; Lewis-Nielsen model; Maxwell model; Ti-based MOF","Carbon dioxide; Filled polymers; Fillers; Gas permeable membranes; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Morphology; Titanium; Titanium compounds; Acid gas; Acid gas removal; CO2 permeability; Hybrid membrane; Hydrocarbon ligands; Lewis-nielsen model; Maxwell-model; Nielsen model; Ti-based; Ti-based MOF; Ligands","","","13835866","","SPUTF","2-s2.0-85198521375"

However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron holes, the complexity of the reduction products and the consumption of sacrificial materials severely limit its development and application. In this work, g-C3N4-PDI (CNP) and MOF-545-NH2 (MNH) were prepared by calcination and hydrothermal methods, respectively, and CNP/MNH photocatalysts were prepared by in situ growth of MNH on CNP surface. The photocatalytic CO2 conversion reaction of CNP/MNH in triethanolamine and aniline solutions was investigated. Experiments show that the prepared CNP/MNH catalyst has excellent photocatalytic performance. When triethanolamine was used as a sacrificial agent, the yield of CH4 reached 192.7 μmol·g−1·h−1 (selectivity 92.94 %). In particular, while the catalyst realizes the conversion of CO2 in the aniline solution, it is surprising to find that part of the CO2 is converted to ethanol. The catalyst's photochemical properties, CO2 reduction pathway, and aniline oxidation products were characterized by XPS, UV–vis DRS, PL, electrochemistry, zeta potential, ESR, GC–MS and in-situ infrared spectroscopy. The results show that the modification of the catalyst and the formation of heterojunction not only increase the adsorption of CO2, but also accelerate the process of photogenerated electron migration, which plays an important role in the process of carbon dioxide conversion.

However, the poor heterogeneous bonding ability between crystals and the substrate leads to the unsatisfactory gas separation as well as low stability of MOF membranes, especially in the humid environment. Herein, we prepared a thin and defect-free UiO-66 membrane by a crystal heterogeneous nucleation assisted growth strategy for efficient CO2/N2 separation. The addition of small amount of water in the precursor solution promoted the crystal nucleation process on the substrate surface. Meanwhile, the smooth PDMS interlayer guaranteed the heterogeneous well-intergrown of crystals into thin UiO-66 membranes, and provided a hydrophobic environment. Therefore, the dense UiO-66 membrane with a small thickness exhibited a high CO2 permeance (177.4 × 10−9 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1) with moderate CO2/N2 selectivity (24.3) under humid conditions. Furthermore, the prepared membrane demonstrated excellent renewable performance after dehumidification at high temperature, and maintained good hydrothermal stability during long-term operation under the humid environment.

However, the further application of MMMs is severely impeded owing to the non-ideal interface between fillers and polymer matrix. In this work, a series of MIL-101(Cr) nanofillers, equipped with different kinds of counter anions were introduced to regulate the chemical microenvironment of the MMMs and improve the interfacial relationship between inorganic filler and polymer. The filler of MIL-101-HNO3 exhibits improved dispersibility in solvents and heightened interface relationship with the polymer matrix (PIM-1) due to its optimal particle size and distinctive exposure of crystallographic planes. Moreover, gas sorption isotherms reveal that the MIL-101-HNO3 MOF show reduced N2 adsorption capacity. Therefore, the MOF filler of MMMs were optimized rationally by microenvironment regulate strategy, leading to the MIL-101-HNO3/PIM-1 MMMs achieve high CO2 permeability and exceptional CO2/N2 ideal selectivity (CO2 = 14879 barrer, CO2/N2 = 24.3), surpassing the latest 2019 upper bound.

Importantly, benefiting from preserving UIO-66-(OH)2′s porosity in PLs, the affinity of PEAs’ ethylene oxide segments for CO2 via Lewis acid-base interactions, and additional free space within organic chains, UIO-66-PLs revealed enhanced CO2 adsorption capabilities, particularly for CO2 over N2.

In this work, a high CO2-affinity MOF-based nanofiller (Pin@NH2-UiO-66) was prepared and integrated in polyetherimide (PEI) to prepare mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for enhanced CO2/CH4 separation capabilities. The Pin@NH2-UiO-66 nanofiller comprised an in situ-formed polyethyleneimine-NH2-UiO-66 composite prepared via a one-pot synthesis. The polyethyleneimine was covalently attached to the H2BDC-NH2 ligand allowing for a stronger integration within the PEI matrix. The polyethyleneimine affects the nucleation of MOF, leading to miniaturization of the MOF particles. The smaller-sized filler is beneficial for improved interaction at the filler-matrix interface. The numerous amino functionalities grafted onto the NH2-UiO-66 increased the CO2 adsorption sites, thereby enhancing the affinity for CO2. Owing to the improved interaction, the elevated CO2 attraction, and the inherent properties of the porous NH2-UiO-66, the fabricated MMMs preformed superior in separating CO2/CH4. The 30-Pin@NH2-UiO-66-PEI membrane (containing 30 wt% nanofiller) exhibited a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 27.7 and a CO2 permeability of 2498.9 Barrer. The CO2 permeability was 21 times greater than that of the pristine PEI membrane, and 4 times higher compared to P@NH2-UiO-66 MMM with polyethyleneimine modified MOF filler prepared by a traditional wet impregnation method. Additionally, the novel MMM demonstrates excellent separation stability under conditions that mimic industrial settings, demonstrating its potential application for natural gas purification. © 2024","CO<sub>2</sub> separation; In situ formation; Mixed-matrix membrane; MOF nano-filler modification; NH<sub>2</sub>-UiO-66","Air purification; Fillers; Gas permeable membranes; High pressure engineering; Natural gas; CH 4; CO2 separation; Filler modifications; In-situ formations; Mixed-matrix membranes; MOF nano-filler modification; Nanofiller; Natural gas purifications; NH2-UiO-66; Poly(ethyleneimine); Carbon dioxide","","","13835866","","SPUTF","2-s2.0-85196489597"
